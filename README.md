# keyz
this code is for scanning points. eg if you want to find a certain amount of points from G (or any public key) for example you convert the uncompressed public key from headecimal to decimal (after you have removed the leading 04). then it will ask you how many points you want to scan than you press enter then it will scan. good luck
